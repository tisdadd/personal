# src

The main source code of the application.

- [components/](components/readme.md) - Components used in more than one section of the application.
- [contexts/](contexts/readme.md) - Custom contexts used inside of the application belong here.
- [views/](views/readme.md) - Views (could be the content of a screen or modal - something with stand along functionality) used in the application belong here.
- App.tsx - The main entrypoint to the application. Place routes here with links to the views - wrapped in a RootLayout this handles pages in the application. RootLayout can be customized for a consistent header, footer, and navigation menu if needed.
- env.js - For allowing environment variables to be simulated after build, uses [react-inject-env](https://github.com/codegowhere/react-inject-env).
- index.css - Default css for this application.
- index.tsx - The actual jsx entry point - this is what is loaded into the public/index.html file.
- react-app-env.d.ts - This is generated by CRA (and [should regenerate if deleted](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6560)) ~~for the sole sake of messing with people's organization~~ for the sake of adding type definitions allowing pulling in of assets such as images. Do not delete or add it to gitignore, and it cannot be relocated to a different location without screwing up some of the scripts.
- reportWebVitals.ts - Uses the [web-vitals](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) package to [measure performance](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/measuring-performance/). Activated in the index.tsx.
- setupTests.ts - A [config for things to run before your tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/).
