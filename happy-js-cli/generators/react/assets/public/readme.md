# Public

Files in the [public folder](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/) are not optimized (and are outside of the build system)! There are a few specific reasons to add more files here to serve, but be sure to know why. Also, this readme file is safe to remove at the build time. Favicon format items are used in the manifest as well for making a progressive web app.

- favicon.ico - One of the [favicon formats](https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/) for the site.
- index.html - The HTML entry point for the application. As this is a Single Page Application using Create React App, you may need to configure the server to send traffic here by default.
- logo192.png - One of the [favicon formats](https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/) for the site.
- logo512.png - One of the [favicon formats](https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/) for the site.
- manifest.json - [Standard webapp manifest](https://web.dev/add-manifest/).
- robots.txt - [Robots Exclusion Protocol](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) - remember, only good bots respect it so don't depend on it for security.
