# Default React View

A sample view structure, based on the Default Next Home page - however, it has been heavily modified to reflect tailwind where possible. Note that classes for dark mode and some other bits have been left out, as this is not expected to be the end view.

- [components/](components/readme.md) - Components used to make this view.
- DefaultNextView.stories.tsx - Stories for this view
- DefaultNextView.test.tsx - Tests for this view
- index.js - Easy import elsewhere.
