# UI

The application front end code (React) lives here.

- [components/](components/readme.md) - Components used in more than one section of the application.
- [contexts/](contexts/readme.md) - Custom contexts used inside of the application belong here.
- [views/](views/readme.md) - Views (could be the content of a screen or modal - something with stand along functionality) used in the application belong here.
- App.tsx - The main React application - routes end up here when a new view is made.
- index.tsx - The main entry point to mount the React application.
