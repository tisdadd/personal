# backend

Code meant to run on the backend belongs here.

- [mainInit/](mainInit/readme.md) - Initializes the main process (which launches browser windows for the rendering).
- simpleDatabase.ts - A very simple [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) NoSQL database for this example. Since NeDB is no longer maintained, it is recommended to replace this with what is actually wanted for most cases.
