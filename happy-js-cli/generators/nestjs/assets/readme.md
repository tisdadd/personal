# HFC NestJS Starter Kit

This is generated by the [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) CLI along with a few extra bits (some more linters, rate limiting, helmet, and this readme for instance).

## Available Scripts

- `build` - Builds the static application
- `generate` - Proxy through to the [Nest CLI generate](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages). Recommend using this for most things. `npm run generate resource` will give the possibility of a CRUD resource already registered, but recommend checking those docs for more.
- `format` - format files using [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- `start` - Start in full development mode with file watch reloads and debug
- `start:dev` - Start with file watch reloads
- `start:debug` - Start in full development mode with file watch reloads and debug
- `start:prod` - Start the built code
- `start:static` - The original `start` command - just starts the server, but not for production. Need to stop/start to see changes.
- `lint` - full lint and fix
- `test` - Runs jest
- `test:watch` - Runs jest in watch mode
- `test:cov` - Runs jest and gives coverage report
- `test:debug` - Runs jest in debug mode.
- `test:e2e` - Runs tests against the server in end to end mode.

## Files/Folders

- coverage/ - Generated test coverage information - made by the `test:cov` command.
- dist/ - The files for distribution - can get production files by running the `build` command.
- [src/](src/readme.md) - The main code for the application.
- [test/](test/readme.md) - Test configuration and spec file for not unit testing. Unit tests should live next to their respective component.
- [.eslintrc.js](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/) - Configures eslint.
- [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) - Files to ignore when checking into source system.
- [.prettierrc](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) - Prettier configuration file
- docker-compose.yml - A standard [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file if desiring to run inside of docker in dev mode. If you are looking to simulate linkage to other services/areas, this may be a good spot to start - it includes commented out redis/mssql setup. It is recommended to move the environment variables into the .env file, but they are sampled there.
- [nest-cli.json](https://json.schemastore.org/nest-cli) - Configuration for the cli. Much is generated, occasionally add in a plugin or configure specially.
- [package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json) - File giving full versions of things installed with npm, and their dependencies.
- [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json) - Describes project, including dependencies, scripts, ect. A good starting point when looking at any node project.
- tsconfig.build.json - Extension of tsconfig.json for use when building the project.
- [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) - Typescript configurations.

## First Configuration Steps After Setup

Figure out what [security](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/authentication) you will need for your project beyond what is provided. Helmet is provided, along with default rate limiting - no authentication or authorization is though. For that - please use a method that doesn't use JWT (JSON Web Tokens)'s if possible. Additionally, if you have forms you may need to protect against CRSF(Cross Site Request Forgery).

Next, figure out what storage types you are using - in the docker-compose file you may be ready to roll with MS SQL and redis being uncommented, or you may only require redis, or maybe everything is static. Since this is an API, most likely there will be user input that you want to store. If you are using a SQL backend, check out the [sequelize recipe](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/sql-sequelize). Don't forget to set up [migrations](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/migrations/) right away to have a good history of what happened to the database.

For other connections, there should be similar in the docs - check out titles and see if anything stands out as I want that in my api.

## FAQ

- Why is this readme.md instead of README.md?
  - All of the other files (config, ect) in the modern world no longer have the convention of all caps, and it helps to keep eyes from being drawn to this file instead of other, potentially more important files in the file tree.
- Why are readme.md files scattered around the repo?
  - For every file/folder that you create, it should be easy to have a reason behind it. This makes an easy way to document it. Additionally, you can place TODOs and easily parse it out into a readable format. Finally, it is meant to be easy navigation of documents straight in a git graphical interface (github, gitlab, ect). This allows a quick high level overview for newcomers curious about something, and also allows the component to be pulled off to its own module quickly if needed.
