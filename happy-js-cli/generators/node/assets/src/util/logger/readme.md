# logger

Sample logger for use in the project, with the ability to be turned off via command line. This could be used as a base, though you may want to consider a different logger (such as [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)) and just use their structure depending upon your use case.

- [util/](util/readme.md) - Utility functions for this logger.
- index.js - For easier import elsewhere
- logger.jsx - The actual Context Provider Wrapper
- logger.test.js - Tests for this provider
