# Exam Insights After Taking

Just a quick brain dump of things that I am allowed to share according to the rules. After watching the video's, and reviewing the docs, things that were in the Exam Guide, but not overly emphasized and showed up a bit more than I thought they would as a result.

These included
- Amazon Athena - Make sure to know what it is, but didn't need super in depth for what I saw
- Amazon Kinesis - This showed up more frequently than I would have thought, so recommend knowing a bit more than what it is but also some use cases for different parts.
- AWS Backup - This showed up for me enough to recommend knowing Use Cases.
- Amazon GuardDuty - Know what this is
- Amazon Inspector - Know what this is
- Amazon Macie - Know what this is, and possible use cases.
- AWS Secrets Manager - Know what this is
- AWS Key Management Service - Know use cases with this.
