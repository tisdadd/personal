- [Benefits of Cloud Computing](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)
  - Agility - Quick access to multiple techs allow building out what you need as you need it
  - Elasticity - You may scale the resources you need as you need them, up or down
  - Cost Savings - No need to maintain your own servers (and employee time keeping them running), and variable expenses cheaper because of economies of scale
  - Deploy Globally in Minutes - With servers closer to end users, your application latency is less
- [Types of Cloud Computing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/types-of-cloud-computing.html)
  - Cloud Computing Models
